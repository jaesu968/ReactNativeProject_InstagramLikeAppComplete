## üß† Key Concepts

- **Authentication context**: Centralizes `signIn`, `signOut`, and `isSignedIn` state to gate navigation (`App.js:104`).
- **Navigation layering**: Combines a stack navigator for onboarding with a tab navigator for main content to deliver role-based flows (`App.js:123`).
- **Memoized providers**: Uses `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary rerenders when auth state changes (`App.js:114`).
- **Safe area handling**: Wraps feed content in `SafeAreaProvider`/`SafeAreaView` for notch-safe layouts (`components/Woof.js:143`).
- **Mock content pipeline**: Supplies locally defined pet and post data to prototype UI without a backend (`components/Woof.js:154`).

---

## üß© Key Elements

- **Sign-up form**: Scrollable registration flow with typed inputs and password confirmation (`SignUp.js:24`).
- **Custom form field**: Reusable labeled input component for consistent styling across forms (`components/Custom.tsx:4`).
- **Feed surface**: Combined horizontal and vertical `FlatList` views for trending pets and long-form posts (`components/Woof.js:124`).
- **Account screen**: Simple profile area with sign-out control wired to the auth context (`App.js:62`).
